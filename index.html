            An Accordion Fold refers to a document folding method that uses a series of alternating folds to create multiple panels of a similar size. The parallel pleats formed by the alternating folds resemble the expandable mid-section of an Accordion musical instrument, hence the name "Accordion Fold."

            Only use an accordion if there's evidence it's helpful for the user to:
            see an overview of multiple, related sections of content.
            choose to show and hide sections that are relevant to them.
            look across information that might otherwise be on different pages.
